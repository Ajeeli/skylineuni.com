                    <p class="main-text">The greatest challenges that our world faces today require skills that belie singular modes of understanding. As this era is defined by rapid social, technological and economic changes, the liberal arts model of education and inquiry is perhaps more relevant today than ever before. The education conferred by the College of Sciences is a recipe for creating an intellect that is well formed and highly versatile. It is also the best long-term training for innovation, entrepreneurship and civic leadership.</p>
                    <p class="main-text">At Skyline, we embrace both heritage and invention. Our openness to intersecting paths is a deep part of who we are. Interdisciplinary collaboration and scholarship is at our foundation. We are a strong academic community continuously generating new ideas. We challenge our students to expand their imaginations while sharpening their critical and creative responses to all they encounter. We are independent and diverse students and scholars on our own paths toward discovery and transformation. Our college is the nexus of Cornell, offering humanityâ€™s greatest opportunity for innovation, creativity and illumination of pathways to the future. </p>
